AEM installation

1) Pre-requisites
	- firewalld service must be enabled and correctly configured as per follows:
		- firewall-cmd --add-port=4502/tcp --permanent
		- firewall-cmd --add-port=4503/tcp --permanent
		- firewall-cmd --reload
	
	- java must be installed

2) Installation process
	AEM has two instances to work, Author and Publish instance. Although there is only one jar file, the installation process relies on the name convention
	the jar file has, in order to install Author instance it will be required to rename jar file as per follows:
		- cq-<instance>-p<port>.jar
		e.g. cq-author-p4502.jar (In this case I want to install Author instance through port 4502)
	2.1) Author instance:
		 2.1.1) Create a folder within /opt named "aem", optionally a sub-folder can be created named as per the instance you'd like to install, in this particular
		 case I'll be using "author", finally I'll have a path as follows:
			e.g. /opt/aem/author
		 2.1.2) Within this recently created folder I'll be placing the jar file (as this is the author sub-folder I would recommend to place the author jar file),
		    e.g. /opt/aem/author/cq-author-p4502.jar
		 * If this is the very first time the application gets executed you will be promped into a webpage where a lincence number would be required in order to proceed,
		 place this license number and a lincense.properties file would be created automaticlly just aside the jar file (in this particular case within /opt/aem/author),
		 this can be reused in order to avoid this step in future.
		 2.1.3) Execute jar file with following command:
			java -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx1024M -jar <jar file>
			e.g. java -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx1024M -jar cq-author-p4502.jar
		 This execution would start instance on port selected (this case port 4502), you might want to go a check (it may take 5-10 min depending on your machine),
		 once you see AEM's content you can do a Cntrl+c in order to exit process which would stop instance as well.
		 2.1.4) A new folder would be created if previous step was performed correctly (crx-quickstart), go inside this folder and you may now find a "bin" folder where
		 you can find an start/stop triggers in order to start and stop the instance, these two files are now up to date and can be used directly to start and stop
		 instance. Forward, there is on the same folder (crx-quickstart) a "logs" folder to monitor the start and the stop logs just in case you have doubts about the
		 start-up process (stdout.log).
		
	2.2) Publish Instance:
		 2.2.1) Create a sub-folder within "aem" folder named "publish", should look like as follows:
			- /opt/aem/publish
		 2.2.2) Within this new folder place either a copy or same jar file used to install "Author Instance", just rename it as per follows:
			- /opt/aem/publish/cq-publish-p4503.jar
		 * If you have doubts on why the name convention please go through step 2 again.
		 2.2.3) Execute jar file as per step 2.1.3 explains, just remember to copy your license.properties file created on previous installation
		  in the same location where your jar file is located at. (In this particular case would be within /opt/aem/publish).
		 2.2.4) Once application is up and running by executing following command on jar file:
			e.g. java -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx1024M -jar cq-publish-p4503.jar (This because I want my publish instance be shown on port 4503)
		 You may now press Cntrl+c in order to stop application and move within the recently created folder (crx-quickstart) and modify "start" script.
		  - Using your text editor find these two code lines:
			# TCP port used for stop and status scripts
			  if [ -z "$CQ_PORT" ]; then
              CQ_PORT=4502
              fi
			  
			# runmode(s)                                       
            # will not be used if repository is already present
            if [ -z "$CQ_RUNMODE" ]; then                      
                    CQ_RUNMODE='author'                       
            fi
			
			Make the proper changes in order to adapt it to start publish instance, do as follows:
			
			# TCP port used for stop and status scripts
			  if [ -z "$CQ_PORT" ]; then
              CQ_PORT=4503
              fi
			  
			# runmode(s)                                       
            # will not be used if repository is already present
            if [ -z "$CQ_RUNMODE" ]; then                      
                    CQ_RUNMODE='publish'                       
            fi
			
			*This way we will be using port 4503 to start the publish instance, exit/save text editor and test "start" script. If steps were performed correctly
			you should see once again content was shown when executed through java application the very first time.
